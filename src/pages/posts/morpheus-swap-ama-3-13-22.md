#### Any news about upcoming partnerships, what is the status of previously mentioned partnerships?

A: Our main focus is on Solidly and sorting out revenue with it. Nothing concrete right now, talking with a few protocols, aggregators. xSCREAM removed because scream announced they were launching a pool on Solidly and liquidity moved there.

#### Is the Frog Nation dao continuing?

A: From emissions perspective it is very low weight in our total emissions. There are no plans to remove the pool. In terms of farms we are focused on our core liquidity and increasing those (FTM, MIM, USDC, etc).

#### What about potential partnerships, specifically Beethoven X?

A: We like Beethoven X (BEETS), it's a fork of balancer with a good team. Reiterating focus is on Solidly. We didn't expect revenue to turn out like it did. We are going to list PILLS/FTM on Solidly. We are talking with Abracadabra to whitelist. Treasury will use funds to buy SOLID and increase votes. Encourage others to do so too. We are looking for synergies all the time with good projects like beets.

#### Who does Morpheus Swap have the best synergy with?

A: BEETS, builder mindset, LQDR, driving liquidity to FTM dexes.

#### Thinking in web marketing, would you add a blog with staking strategies as a way to drive more investors to PILLS?

A: We do have resources on Medium like idm's monthly summaries. We do have some resources that community members have made. We like the idea of putting it all in one place.

#### What about the spirit merger? Why didn't it go through? Is it something we might consider in the future or do we go on our own with Solidly?

A: It was a proposal to integrate into SpiritSwap master router so we would have gone into that to provide better incentives to cross chain tokens. It would have helped there liquidity as well. Percentage of rev would have been shared, mutual benefit. There was drama with Sifu, he was an advisor at the time for us. Spirit announced they would pause the vote and communication went downhill. Sifu had zero access on our side. The deal fell through. We are now happy that it did, our teams don't mesh well along with trust issues. Right now nothing makes sense for us to merge with. Our focus is on Solidly.

#### What criteria is used for a project to be listed?

A: If anyone wants to list it has to go through approval. We will be using governance for that because emissions have to be targeted towards those pools. Currently we want to focus more on core liquidity because it brings in volume/revenue. FTM/USDC has been bringing in a lot through dex aggregators. No specific criteria, we look at target liquidity, dual rewards, etc.

#### Is Morpheus Swap partnering with OxDAO (rumors on twitter)?

A: Not true, we are not partnered with them. We have had discussions before things launched. we didn't share the same goal as far as how to route revenue.

#### What are plans to migrate PILLS/FTM back to Morepheus Swap?

A: From first glance it might look strange to not have our native token on our dex. Two things: 1) higher incentives for our farm from dual rewards on LQDR 2) keeping the lp there lets us target emissions for liquidity we need on our dex for aggregator volume. no plans to change it right now. LQDR will still have dual rewards. starting thursday we will add Solidly as well.

#### Are we planning to integrate with other aggregators?

A: Looking into paraswap and Yoshi (a fiat onramp/dex aggregator for FTM).

#### What do you see as the main source of trading volume moving forward and how do we plan to grow volume?

A: Main focus is aggregator volume.

#### What was the reason for picking 2 mods instead of outsiders for expansion of multisig?

A: With our multisig we are doing lots of transactions with farm transactions, allocations, Neo pools, treasury, etc. Needed team members familiar with the project and operations. Need cooperation sometimes quickly and people need to be available that understand what's going on. we feel comfortable with the picks.

#### Are we a 1 man development crew?

A: Not a 1 man dev team, it did start that way. 2 full time devs, front end dev and Morpheus on backend contracts for now with side contributors.

#### What about behind the scenes insider knowledge/trading?

A: Higher level roadmap stuff, aware briefly before others to answer questions. Being online a lot helps. There is no major alpha released ahead of time to mods.

#### Is Morpheus Swap getting another advisor?

A: At the current time no. We aren't looking to fill any positions right now as all main bases are covered. We may need to add a dev team member in the future.

#### Are the teams wallets doxxed? Including mods/comm managers? if not do we plan to?

A: We have never withheld information about treasury/where funds are going.

#### What happened to the scheduled chat with FTM alerts? Is there a plan to do that?

A: Currently it has fallen through. Might expect it in the future.

#### What are our marketing plans for the short and long term?

A: There's a development underway to help people understand the project, add statistics, revenue dashboard. We can pump out educational material using that.

#### What about partnership with Abracasabra and how does it work?

A: Originally it was done as collab with Wonderland/Frog Nation. It's a shared NFT where we earn 50% of what MIM/USDC makes. As to why they haven't voted it is a question for them.

#### What about timing of harvests with Solidly and why it missed last Neo pool round?

A: Problems with the UI as far as claiming, we did queue, revenue is ready but required a direct contract call to work around the UI. we have had to wait on multisig tx signs sometimes but that's how it is with multisigs.

#### Is treasury accumulating solid?

A: Yes treasury will be buying.

#### What about borrowing against staked PILLS?

A: Getting a safe model to work with our revenue share requires a lot of dev work. Instead of earning more PILLS/SUSHI/SPIRIT we pay out in non-native tokens. It is possible but it would take a lot of work to deploy, so that is something for the future. It is an idea to go back to.

#### What about going multichain?

A: No, lots to be done on FTM and that is our focus. We want to develop new value instead of reboot on other chains.

#### What about consistent communications?

A: Some weekly communications would be good, we may start doing consistent scheduled AMAs for updates.

#### Are the NFTs mentioned in the roadmap as revenue?

A: On the backburner.

#### What about fixed forex?

A: Can't make promises but looking into it. Working on Solidly and sorting that out now.

#### What about Neo pools, will they only have wFTM?

A: The main focus is to bring everything into one main mostly stable token like wFTM. The PILLS Neo pool is additional from the treasury and is phasing out. There are no plans to add another token.

#### Can dev do something?

A: Yeah dev can do something. Dev is always doing something.

#### What about v2 being wonky?

A: Please report any issues, we are issuing consistent updates. Legacy is still online but can't support dual reward farms.

#### Who controls keys to veNFT?

A: We won't be able to redirect any votes. We are discussing using it for the whitelist of PILLS on Solidly.

#### Summary

-   PILLS/FTM will be listed on Solidly where the focus is
-   More consistent updates with amas/community events
-   Team always on the lookout for other projects to work with
