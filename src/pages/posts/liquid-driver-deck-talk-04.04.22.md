This 4th of April 2022, was held another great Deck Talk in LQDR discord.

You can listen to it [here](https://odysee.com/@LiquidDriver:0/Deck-Talk-44:9) (Don’t miss the early music!).

If you don't feel like listening to it all (that one was kind of short tho!), here’s a brief summary of the key points discussed:

#### 1/ Meme contest organized by the community

The Corgi Meme Contest ended, and everyone is very grateful to Corgi for the organization. It was a great moment for us all.

[A new meme contest](https://twitter.com/paralengrip/status/1510690762870210561) started on Twitter at the initiative of an other crewmember, focused on both @LiquidDriver and @beethoven_x being at the Pirate party.

Do not miss this one, and more even, do not miss the bribes to come this 5th of April 2022 for two consecutive weeks on BeethovenX!

#### 2/ Security is key

Do take care to any DM you receive on Discord. If you don't know the sender, it's most likely a scam. If you know them, be sure it's really the person you know!

Seems some bots have been hacked, and the social engineering is getting better and better.

#### 3/ Governance acquisition

Proposing a liquid version of a locked or ve asset means you need to also provide an exit, meaning maintaining a good PEG (>99%). It has a cost, so we can’t just wrap everything.

When choosing a token to wrap, we need to think to a strategy and how to bring more value both to the users and to xLQDR holders.

The focus being on the sweet spot between acquired value for xLQDR and paid price.

Emissions have a high cost.

#### 4/ Performances

cLQDR by @GrowthDefi passed 2% of total xLQDR ownership (>50k). cLQDR is in the top 10 xLQDR holder.

Discord has a steady growth & retention rate, indicating that new comers feel welcomed on board. Not a surprise. We passed the 40k followers on Twitter at @LiquidDriver.

More metrics and analysis to come when all the big work on Shadow Farm slows a bit.

#### 5/ Crew NFTs

There are only 15 remaining for level 5. Some more for levels 10 and 15. Join Discord to learn more about this! There is a whole new collection to come in collaboration with the community. As everything we do, no hurry, just make it great!

#### 6/ APR development for xLQDR

Remember DEUS distribution is only temporary following a trade made between the two projects. There is no recurrent DEUS accumulation. APR may fall after those 60 days of distribution end...or not?!

#### 7/ New strategy

Last details of the v3 to be finalized. There was a lot of shipping in March, Shadow Farms to be released in coordination with @Spirit_Swap team to have a simultaneous launch with their v2. Better do things together!

#### 8/ Shadow Farms

At start, it should lead to a reduction of APR for xLQDR, but the reduced emissions will be more beneficial in the long term. LQDR is going to be harder and harder to farm. We are in a fast growing industry, but need to keep feet on the ship to sail far!

#### 9/ DEUS

Lowered emission of DEUS for the DEI/USDC, and cut for FTM/DEUS. Everything will be distributed as part of the emission strategy in partnership with DEUS team & Lafa.

#### 10/ Reddit

The Reddit community can be happy to know Liquid Martin is working on the bot to track that also! We won’t stick to Twitter and get to expand the seas we travel.

#### 11/ Revenant (already past at time of submitting!)

April 5th, don't miss the AMA we host with @RevenantLabs at 6PM UTC.
