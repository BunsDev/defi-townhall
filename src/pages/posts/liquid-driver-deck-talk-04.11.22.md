As every week, today was held a Deck Talk on the @LiquidDriver ship!
<br>  
You can listen to the recording <a href="https://odysee.com/@LiquidDriver:0/Deck-Talk-ShadowDAO:2" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### DeBank voting

Live votes:

-   **cLQDR** : <a href="https://debank.com/vote/12413" target="_blank">https://debank.com/vote/12413</a>
-   **slinSPIRIT** : <a href="https://debank.com/vote/12725" target="_blank">https://debank.com/vote/12725</a>
-   Implementation of tokens is community driven, so do not hesitate to vote!

#### Shadow DAO

How best to convert $LQDR in a fully functional DAO : by a transitional shift, using a cooperative-like system before going slowly to DAO.

It’ll be better to grow along with community members, and show what are the key steps that are needed to succeed as a protocol.

Only the treasury will work as a committee for now, other tasks would be run with heads of departments.

More information will be sent in a document to read, but here would be the core jobs:

-   @DrLiquid fought hard to get a 3 member spot for the treasury committee alongside 4 core members.
-   NFT task force in order to grow something community driven
-   Marketing: infographics, writing, tweets, describing the talk, general documentation, translation,

#### Why change leadership

Project has been started to become a DAO, so it is all natural. The Shadow DAO is only a step from centralized to decentralized. Although, it’ll remain pretty centralized during the transition phase. The goal is to show to the community it can work successfully, and that they can bring more than they think.

#### How to learn the ways to DAO

There are no books, 20 years of history, and so on. So it is important to learn by experience, with trying to get the better of it and avoiding too many risks. Changing 180° in a day would most likely fail. When an idea comes from the community, it becomes more genuine. Because of this, we need to show how members can become part of the project, not only by buying tokens. There is a high hope right now, as the community has already proven active.

#### @beethoven_x $fBEETS

On some topics, strategy has to be implemented fast, and not announced before it is live in order to not be front-runned. So it can't always go from a community vote. For example, the decision to buy 1M fBEETS could not decently be put to vote.

#### @SpiritSwap strategy

It is good to build new use cases for our wrappers to drive the demand. By increasing our shares in #SPIRIT, it’ll also allow us to bring more voting power to our FTM/LQDR pool. With the new Shadow Farms, it should increase the velocity of acquisition and thus benefit everyone.

#### @market_xyz and slinSPIRIT as collateral

They could launch the pool very soon. It is a matter of coordination between @market_xyz and @QiDaoProtocol. The oracle has been set, the contracts communicated. Let’s have everyone aligned together!

$slinSPIRIT will be used only as a pure supply token, and may be seen as another way of locking some of our linSPIRIT (except if liquidation happens, stay safe!). Should be a 1M pool on day one, little to no risk for the PEG even in case of full liquidation.

We will have our own pool there, and it will be the first with a 10% platform fee, shared between @LiquidDriver and @market_xyz. We’ll then expand the pool with more of our wrapped tokens to come.

#### Passing the bear market?

It is good to see the community is still very active, unlike some other projects the market movements had no impact on the Discord’s life. We do not talk about the price, whether it goes up or down. We just work on building the best product.

Thank you everyone for joining!
