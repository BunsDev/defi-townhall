#### Mission

Helping users, making liquid staking safe for everyone. Plans to replicate their $1B TVL protocol actually running on Terra. Will expand to #FTM in the coming weeks, then on other chains. @hedera, @0xPolygon and @solana to follow soon!

Looking to bridge the gaps caused by the three main validators of a network by providing more safe decentralization.

#### The team

More than ten years of experience for co-founders, in startups and crypto : @GAmitej (CEO), Sid (CTO) and Dheeraj

#### Strategy on Terra

Meeting customer experience.
Understand what communities want, listen to them. The team passed a few months just for that before starting to build anything. Today, it’s a 60000 members large community.

From this emerged the need : a better way of staking.
Stader offers a solution to a lot of unused capital while benefiting the network.

On Terra, we’re offering both a compounding staking and a liquid staking to our users.

#### Why #FTM?

Starting on one blockchain, but with the goal to expand to multiple ones in due time.
Unique tech and DeFi on #FTM was attractive, but the active and collaborative community was the key point.
Happy to be part of that!

#### How #FTM?

It’s key to understand the network itself, its specificity, what works and doesn’t for validators. What the community is looking for.
It will help secure decentralization, delegating with smaller validators.
Liquid staking is key regarding the importance of the DeFi ecosystem to give more use cases.

#### Change in roadmap

Liquid staking wasn’t planned at first, but seemed the best option for the community needs and wishes. It will stay adaptable regarding the needs adn demands of the community.

#### Staking itself

Now, when staking, the capital is locked and unused. But delegating is important for the network. With $sFTMx it will be able to both support the system and participate in DeFi.
Tokens will be staked for the longest duration, getting the highest reward possible.

#### Validators

Validators will be chosen. “There will be clear requirements on safety, performance, community presence to be eligible”

#### Exit ways

With $sFTMx, it will be possible to also earn extra yield providing liquidity and offer an exit for who wants.
Will also be possible to withdraw directly from Stader. (free while using the buffer, ata cost if larger amount is asked)

#### The exit buffer

Will be fueled by 5 days of rewards and deposit at start. That will evolve as the protocol grows in order to maximize revenue without reducing that doorway. People can withdraw with penalty out of the buffer, but we want to minimize that need.

#### PEG maintenance

Will be mostly maintained trusting in arbitrage opportunities to be done between liquidity pools and the platform itself. (minting or exit way)
There will be work done to ensure strong buy pressure.
$sFTMx being backed by $FTM, the biggest expected risks are slashing (reduced by selection) and too many early withdrawal (reduced by the range of use cases)

#### Partnerships in #FTM for use cases

Make it as useful or more than $FTM itself with extravalue.
Actually in talks with many partners, undisclosed so far.
As example of possible good symbiotic relationships to add a layer to the 10%+ compounding rewards :@Spiritswap, @beethoven_x, @RevenantLabs (Creditum), @TarotFinance, @LiquidDriver, @HundredFinance, @Reaper_Farm, …
Goal is to make users to hold sFTMx instead of FTM. (good for both the ecosystem and the users)

#### Safety

Absolute paramount.
Multiple audits for each product and contracts.
Really experienced team focused on security. Terra’s team will be backing FTM’s for that.
Partnering for bug bounties.

Focusing only on the native token of the networks
That's the actual goal, mostly because of safety, but also to help the ecosystems. That’s the actual mission.

#### Liquid pools

FTM/sFTMx, USDC is explored only for now. Will also depend with the partners.
Aiming for really high deapth, using mostly 50/50 and metastable pools. Impairment loss would be really low because of the correlation between $FTM/$sFTMx

#### Other strategy than liquid staking?

From community feedback, just launched a degen strategy on #Terra, integrating the tokens more and more in DeFi. Will be really interesting in #FTM. Could deposit $sFTMx, borrow $FTM, and stake it back for example or use leverage on a liquidity pool on @Tarot.

#### Rewards and bribes for farms

Figuring for the best way within the community, but providing liquidity will obviously be well rewarded!

#### Plan to open a validator

Not planned for now. More focused on diversifying the delegations for decentralization with selected carefully validators. The goal being to help secure the #FTM network while offering liquidity to users.

#### SD token & fees

Token will be available on #FTM.
Works with a revenue sharing model and cross chain governance, with permissionless vote to come quickly. More details to come on launch.
10% of the rewards will be charged (on the max possible output for a year lock)

#### Bridging $sFTMx

Would be a future possibility. Also thinking to build an ETF with multiple liquid staked native tokens to offer exposure to multiple chains in a single product while contributing to all networks.

Thanks everyone for coming, do not forget to Do Your Own Research!

Special thanks to Vibin for the AMA, taking time to answer all the questions and being the first to read that summary!
