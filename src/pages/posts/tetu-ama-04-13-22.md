Tetu.io biweekly AMA
You can find the recording <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kes_hsexjP4" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### Marketing

New marketing team joined and the next steps will move towards having specific sub-pages for each of the products. There is a big range of products and the plan is to simplify for new users.

#### Yield farming

The plan is to make auto-compound as the main product for yield farming.
On polygon a new improved logic for the splitter is being worked on that will result in bigger platform profits.
Also, there are new pretty huge protocols to be integrated and will be launched soon.

#### veBAL

A veBAL strategy is being built but still haven’t launched the Ethereum part because of deployment prices if it needs to be re-deployed, plus waiting on existing gauges to be decided.

#### DEX V2

A Balancer-based DEX (or DEX version 2) is close to launching, but depends on the new UI. As there are no dedicated developers working on it right now, it might be released without the UI as a technical solution.

#### TetuSwap

All TetuSwap vaults will be moved to auto-compound mode, which means the underlying assets will also be yielding rewards. Right now the initial boost is 70% but for TetuSwap vaults it will be 100% but with a 10% fee on the auto-compound.

#### Solidly fork

A new Solidly fork will be launched with many bugs fixed, including critical bugs overlooked by the developers.

#### Developers

Two new solidity developers were integrated in the team.

#### Questions

##### Partnership with Sphere?

It’s going pretty well and we are working very closely. More info @ AMA at Sphere Finance on 15 April

##### Do you plan to integrate Arbitrum Chain?

No, at this time we don’t have any plans to integrate any new chains. We have a lot of ideas and are building products on existing chains. Probably, a bit later.

##### Is any upcoming strategy on 0VIX?

Yes, we are building it. On next week I guess.

##### Make “All” the default tab

Intentional to move focus on product-related vaults instead of a vault list with all vaults. See it <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/872524655251034123/963849565876944916/unknown.png" target="_blank">here</a>.
