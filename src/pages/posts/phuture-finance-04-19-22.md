Weekly marketing working group call - 19/04/2022

Product launch
At the products early stage, our primary marketing strategy is organic marketing so as to acquire interested and committed users naturally. At a later stage, we will combine organic and paid marketing strategies. We are building a product that lasts long because of what it is and not because we are paying people to talk about us.

C4 audit
Audit will be concluded in two days.

Website updates
There will be updates on the website to reflect recent changes.

Phuture Learn
Lots of work has been going on in the Phuture Learn hub. New content pieces available.

New hires
Two new and senior hires. They will be joining us in May. We are presently hiring GoLang, Solidity, and Frontend developers. We are not looking to slow down.

Question: Do we have pre-launch events planned?
There will be something to manage the occassion. We will consider other initiatives after launch.

Question: What can we pay for and what will not be paid for?
It is not about the cost. But about the value of what we do. We will put a launch target and implement the best ideas.

Suggestions: Can we consider incentives for AMA
We will explore that and decide what to do about it
