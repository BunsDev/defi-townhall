Another sunday, another AMA at @MorpheusSwap.

Today is a short one, but answering all the questions asked!

Here were the key point addressed:

#### Goal of talks with @beethoven_x

Plan is mainly to start liquidity there. Looking for advice, tips on the entire process.
Multistep process : minimum amount of liquidity in community pool, have to find a name, then we have to present it to a committee to get it approved and then only can have incentive.

The liquidity should be created in the next few days as a 20/80 $yvFTM / $PILLS boosted pool, but we still need to find a good name for it, and decide how to size the bribes.

#### Incentive on @solidlyexchange

Bigger focus on @beethoven_x which looks more solid.
The LP stays there and not moving, the vote from the treasury also still on that pool.
More on a waiting point.

#### Locking mechanism

We do want to do tokenomic changes. One of the ideas is going to a ve model for governance power. But still brainstorming with the team. Locking is highly likely.

Any decision by the team will be put to a snapshot vote.

#### veNFT

Still shared on multisig with Abracadabra. Nothing much to say about that.

#### Thoughts on FTM ecosystem

Started in September, while #FTM kind of launched really in August. Happy to see the way made by the protocols since this time.

The whole ecosystem seems much less chaotic and more mature, stabilized.
Morpheus do prefer #FTM for its community, the gas prices…
Waiting to see what the EVM can do.

### @FantomFDN incentive program

We haven't applied yet, it’s starting in June.
Still to be decided how it goes and what is done.

#### Impact on the @LiquidDriver pool

Opening liquidity on @beethoven_x should increase APR on LQDR as the treasury would move $100k from the $230k staked there.

$LQDR is to implement shadow farms soon which is a totally new system. Not sure the pool will still be there and how.

Talking a little bit with @LiquidDriver. We came up with a strategy, but it still has to be decided, not set in stone. It will be a gradual process. No official talks so far.

#### Marketing

Will try to increase twitter engagement.
When we go to @beethoven_x with a boosted pool, we will do marketing on that.
Most manpower is focused on data analytics right now, to deliver a better product.

Thanks to @MorpheusSwap for this AMA and sharing the latest news!
